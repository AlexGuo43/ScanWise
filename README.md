# QR Code URL Safety Checker

This project is a QR code scanner and URL safety checker built using the OpenCV API and a Random Forest model. The tool captures a QR code using the deviceâ€™s camera, extracts the embedded URL, and classifies it as either safe or malicious. Users can also report a website if they believe it to be malicious, helping to improve future detection accuracy.

## Features
- **QR Code Scanning:** Uses OpenCV to capture and decode QR codes containing URLs.
- **URL Classification:** Employs a Random Forest model to classify URLs as either safe or malicious.
- **User Reporting:** Users can report URLs they believe to be unsafe, which could be used to further improve detection accuracy.

### Python Libraries
- `opencv-python`: for capturing and decoding QR codes
- `sklearn`: for training and using the Random Forest model
- `numpy`, `pandas`: for data handling and preprocessing

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
